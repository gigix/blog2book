				 <p><font size="2"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fort Minor Lyrics: </span><a href="http://www.cs99.cn/upload/file/music/fort-minor_remember_the_name.mp3" style="font-weight: bold;">Remember the Name</a><br /><br />You ready?! Lets go!<br />
Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about<br />
It's like this y'all (c'mon!)<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill<br />
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will<br />
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain<br />
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name!<br />
<br />
Mike! - He doesn't need his name up in lights<br />
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic<br />
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone<br />
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him<br />
But fuck em, he knows the code<br />
It's not about the salary<br />
It's all about reality and making some noise<br />
Makin the story - makin sure his clique stays up<br />
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up! let's go!<br />
<br />
Who the hell is he anyway?<br />
He never really talks much<br />
Never concerned with status but still leavin them star struck<br />
Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact<br />
That many misjudge him because he makes a livin from writin raps<br />
Put it together himself, now the picture connects<br />
Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect<br />
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach<br />
And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist<br />
<br />
It's just twenty percent skill<br />
Eighty percent fear<br />
Be one hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill<br />
Who would've thought that he'd be the one to set the west in flames<br />
And I heard him wreckin with The Crystal Method, &quot;Name Of The Game&quot;<br />
Came back dropped Megadef, took em to church<br />
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?<br />
This dude is the truth, now everybody be givin him guest spots<br />
His stock's through the roof I heard he fuckin with S. Dot!<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
They call him Ryu The Sick<br />
And he's spittin fire with Mike<br />
Got him out the dryer he's hot<br />
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak<br />
Been a fuckin annihilist porcupine<br />
He's a prick, he's a cock<br />
The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot<br />
Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow<br />
Now the record with Shinoda's takin over the globe<br />
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope<br />
You wont believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat<br />
<br />
Tak! - He's not your everyday on the block<br />
He knows how to work with what he's got<br />
Makin his way to the top<br />
People think its a common owners name<br />
People keep askin him was it given at birth<br />
Or does it stand for an acronym?<br />
No he's livin proof, Got him rockin the booth<br />
He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice<br />
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best<br />
Dedicated to what they doin give a hundred percent<br />
<br />
Forget Mike - Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard<br />
It seems like he's never got time<br />
Because he writes every note and he writes every line<br />
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind<br />
It's like a design is written in his head every time<br />
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme<br />
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?<br />
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?!<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus - repeat 2x]</i><br />
<br />
<i>[Outro - Mike Shinoda]</i><br />
Yeah! Fort Minor<br />
M. Shinoda - Styles of Beyond<br />
Ryu! Takbir! Machine Shop!<br />
